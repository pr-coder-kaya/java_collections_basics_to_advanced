SortedMap
-It extends to Map interface.
-It adds a feature that stores all the key-value pairs in this interface to be stored in a sorted manner based on their keys.

Important operations of SortedMap
1. Get first key
    -firstKey() method returns the first (lowest) key in the map.

2. Get last key
    -lastKey() method returns the last (highest) key in the map.

3. Head map key-value pairs
    -headMap(key) method returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are strictly less than the given key..

4. Tail map key-value pairs
    -tailMap(key) method returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are greater than or equal to given key.

5. Sub map key-value pairs
    -subMap(key1, key2) method returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys range from key1, inclusive, to key2, exclusive.

6. Comparator
    comparator() method returns the comparator used to order the keys in the map, or null if the map uses the natural ordering of its keys.
