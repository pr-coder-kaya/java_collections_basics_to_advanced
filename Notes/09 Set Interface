Set Interface

-Set is a collection that does not preserve the insertion order.
-Unlike lists, sets typically do not allow duplicate elements.

-Most used Set implementation classes are HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.
-From these;
    -HashSet does not allow duplicates and can have only one null element and it does not keep insertion order.
    -LinkedHashSet does not allow duplicates and can have only one null element and it keeps insertion order.
    -TreeSet does not allow duplicates or any null element and it sorts the element automatically.
