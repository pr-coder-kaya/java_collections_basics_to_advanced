NavigableSet Interface
-It extends to SortedSet interface.
-It behaves like a SortedSet with the exception of having navigation methods available in addition to the sorting mechanisms of the SortedSet.


Important operations of NavigableSet in addition to SortedSet
1. Find closest element that is less than equal to the given element
    -floor(element) method returns the greatest element in this set less than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.

2. Find closest element that is more than or equal to the given element
    -ceiling(element) method returns the closest element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.

3. Find the greatest element that is less than the given element
    -lower(element) method returns the greatest element in this set less than the given element, or null if there is no such element.

4. Find the smallest element that is more the than given element
    -higher(element) method returns the smallest element in this set more than the given element, or null if there is no such element.

5. Retrieve and remove first element
    -pollFirst() method retrieves and removes the first (lowest) element, or returns null if this set is empty.

6. Retrieve and remove last element
    -pollLast() method retrieves and removes the last (highest) element, or returns null if this set is empty.

7. Reverse order
    -descendingSet() method returns a reverse order view of the elements contained in this set.

8. Reverse ordered iterator
    -descendingIterator() method returns an iterator over the elements in this set, in descending order.
