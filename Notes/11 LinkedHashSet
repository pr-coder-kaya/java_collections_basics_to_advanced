LinkedHashSet
-Difference from HashSet -> insertion order is preserved.
-When iterating through a HashSet the order is unpredictable, while a LinkedHashSet lets us iterate through the elements in the order in which they were inserted.
-LinkedHashSet extends to HashSet class and implements Set interface.
-Duplicate elements are not allowed.
-It keeps the insertion order.
-Only one null element is allowed.

SYNTAX:

LinkedHashSet<T> variableName = new LinkedHashSet<>(collection);
