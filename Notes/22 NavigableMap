NavigableMap Interface
-It extends to SortedMap interface.
-It behaves like a SortedMap with the exception of having navigation methods available in addition to the sorting mechanisms of the SortedMap.

Important operations of NavigableMap in addition to SortedMap
1.
    -floorKey(key) method returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key in the map, or null if the map is empty.

2.
    -floorEntry(key) method returns a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key less than or equal to the given key, or null if there is no such key.

3.
    -ceilingKey(key) method returns the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or null if there is no such key.

4.
    -ceilingEntry(key) method returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or null if there is no such key.

5.
    -lowerKey(key) method returns the greatest key strictly less than the given key, or null if there is no such key.

6.
    -lowerEntry(key) method returns a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key strictly less than the given key, or null if there is no such key.

7.
    -higherKey(key) method returns the least key strictly greater than the given key, or null if there is no such key.

8.
    -higherEntry(key) method returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key strictly greater than the given key, or null if there is no such key.

9.
    -firstEntry() method returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key in the map, or null if the map is empty.

10.
    -lastEntry() method returns a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key in the map, or null if the map is empty.

11.
    -pollFirstEntry() method removes and returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key in the map, or null if the map is empty.

12.
    -pollLastEntry() method removes and returns a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key in the map, or null if the map is empty.

13.
    -descendingMap() method returns a reverse order view of the mappings contained in the map.

14.
    -descendingKeySet() method returns a reverse order NavigableSet view of the keys contained in the map.

15.
    -navigableKeySet() method returns a NavigableSet view of the keys contained in the map.
