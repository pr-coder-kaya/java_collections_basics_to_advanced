Map Interface
-It represents a mapping between a key and a value.
-It is not a subtype of the Collection interface. Therefore it behaves a bit differently from the rest of the collection types.
-A map contains unique keys while values can be duplicated.

Characteristics of a Map Interface
    -A Map cannot contain duplicate keys and each key can map to at most one value.
    -Some implementations allow null key and null values like the HashMap and LinkedHashMap, but some do not like the TreeMap.
    -The order of a map depends on the specific implementations. For example, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap have predictable orders, while HashMap does not.
